Played one match, finished, clicked setup, and then card drawing stopped

Didnt discard finger when fingering lam

double cross left a hole between the first and second mobster placed at the top of the list

substituted andy mobster for vahans, and it gave vahan to me


substitute - menu rebuild/show failed for sandwhich, big lag.
