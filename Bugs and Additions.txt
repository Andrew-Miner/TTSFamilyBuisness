Played valentines day which ended the game and didnt kill the very last guy on the list of 2
Played one match, finished, clicked setup, and then card drawing stopped

cards in dead scripting zone (intrigue, vendetta) dont get placed on hitlist with addMobstersFromTable -- Have HitList track dead mobsters instead of using zones.
Used Double Cross stopped drawing x2

Probably Fixed:
 - Didnt discard finger when fingering lam - probably solved by changing != to ~=
 - SUBSTITUTE STOPPED AN IN PROGRESS MOB WAR WHEN USED - added HitList:isMobWar() check and replace

Additions:
Make sick puppy button say what cards you can send

discard doesnt seem to discard responses

double cross left a hole between the first and second mobster placed at the top of the list

substituted andy mobster for vahans, and it gave vahan to me


substitute - menu rebuild/show failed for sandwhich, big lag.

police protection didn't draw after being played
