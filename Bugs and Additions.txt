Played valentines day which ended the game and didnt kill the very last guy on the list of 2
Played one match, finished, clicked setup, and then card drawing stopped

cards in dead scripting zone (intrigue, vendetta) dont get placed on hitlist with addMobstersFromTable -- Have HitList track dead mobsters instead of using zones.
Used Double Cross stopped drawing x2

Probably Fixed:
 - Didnt discard finger when fingering lam - probably solved by changing != to ~=
 - SUBSTITUTE STOPPED AN IN PROGRESS MOB WAR WHEN USED - added HitList:isMobWar() check and replace

Additions:
Make sick puppy button say what cards you can send

discard doesnt seem to discard responses

double cross left a hole between the first and second mobster placed at the top of the list

substituted andy mobster for vahans, and it gave vahan to me


substitute - menu rebuild/show failed for sandwhich, big lag.

police protection didn't draw after being played


TODO:
substitute - menu rebuild/show failed for sandwhich, big lag SO
Add a timer to substitute and if it finishes replace the earliest mobster
of player with which ever player has the most amount of mobsters.

Maybe add default time options to all mob menu cards

Make sick puppy button say what cards you can send
